# MyChef -- Detailed Case & Business Model

## 1. Executive Overview

MyChef is a verified chef-booking marketplace designed to connect
companies, institutions, and private individuals with professional chefs
for catering and event services.

The platform introduces structure, verification, and secure payments
into a process that is traditionally informal and inefficient.

MyChef focuses on trust, operational efficiency, and financial security
through a verification-first model and escrow-based transaction flow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Market Problem

Organizations frequently struggle with hiring professional chefs for
events such as:

-   Corporate events
-   Church gatherings
-   Government functions
-   Private celebrations
-   Weddings
-   Institutional catering

### Key Challenges

1.  No centralized hiring infrastructure\
2.  Lack of chef verification and background screening\
3.  Informal communication and negotiation\
4.  Payment risk (non-payment or last-minute cancellations)\
5.  No performance tracking or standardized review system\
6.  Time-consuming manual coordination

Chef hiring today relies heavily on word-of-mouth, social media
outreach, or fragmented local networks. This creates inefficiencies and
trust issues for both sides.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Proposed Solution

MyChef introduces a structured digital marketplace where:

-   Chefs must apply and be verified before being visible
-   Clients can post structured event listings
-   Chefs apply to relevant opportunities
-   Payments are processed securely and held in escrow
-   Funds are released only after mutual confirmation of completion
-   Admin oversight ensures accountability

This creates:

-   Reduced hiring friction
-   Improved trust
-   Professionalized onboarding
-   Transparent service history
-   Lower financial risk

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Revenue Model

completed booking before payout to the chef.

This aligns revenue with platform usage and ensures scalability.

A small service fee may be added to client payments to cover processing
and operational costs.
